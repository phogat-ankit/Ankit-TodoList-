I tried to make the legit code for the minor project and made everything but couldn't manage to connect the MongoDB to the code. So in alternate, I made this todolist by Reactjs with reference from youtube.
The main reason that I couldn't do it was because it was new to me as I just joined my college from September,2024 only.
Even though it was taught in the class by Mr. Pratham Saxena sir, I thought it was clear to me but at the time of doing it myself, I just got blank.
I made mistakes many time and corrected it while writing the code and not just copying the whole code.
